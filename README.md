## Run the application as a service

#### Start the service

```sh
$ npm start
```

#### Show the service status

```sh
$  npm status
```
#### Stop the service

```sh
$  npm stop
```

### Logs

All application logs (requests, responses, traces and mongodb accesses) are stored in a file.
The log file path is `~/.pm2/logs/library-example-[id].log`.

#### Read logs

```sh
$ npm run logs
```

#### Read error logs

Show errors in http requests:

```sh
$ tail -f ~/.pm2/logs/[name]-[id].log | node_modules/bunyan/bin/bunyan -c 'this.res && this.res.statusCode >= 500'
```


## Development

The `pre-commit` doesn't allow you to commit files with invalid format.
We use the [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) style guide.
And the tests are going to be checked before the git commit.


#### Run the application

```sh
$ node src/server.js
```

Read the logs better using bunyan:
```sh
$ node src/server.js | ./node_modules/bunyan/bin/bunyan
```


#### Run tests

```sh
$ npm test
```

#### Debug tests

This command initializes node in debug mode and runs the cucumbers.

```sh
$ npm run debug:test
```

#### Versioning

Versioning Used: [Semantic](http://semver.org/)

  - __major__: version when you make incompatible API changes, e.g. 1.0.0
  - __minor__: version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, e.g. 0.1.0
  - __patch__: version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes, e.g. 0.0.1

##### Increase patch version

This command increases the package version, commits changes and create a tag for the new version.

```sh
$ npm run patch
```

##### Increase minor version

This command increases the package version, commits changes and create a tag for the new version.

```sh
$ npm run minor
```

##### Increase major version

This command increases the package version, commits changes and create a tag for the new version.

```sh
$ npm run major
```

#### Run Code Coverage Tool

```sh
$ npm coverage
```
